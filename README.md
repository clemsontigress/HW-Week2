# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. 

I created 3 separate html documents whose navigation bars contain links to the others:
  
   index.html
   portfolio.html
   contact.html

Each page uses semantic html and has been validated using freeformatter.com.
